# Cohorte Runtime

COHORTE is a platform for developing and rolling out robust and reliable software.
Software produced with COHORTE has a high level of robustness and reliability since its is made up of a range of components and services protected from one another by isolation containers.
This modular architecture guarantees that software cannot be paralyzed in the event of failure of one of its components and that, for example, 100% of the data communicated is processed.

This modular architecture ensures automatic service recovery after errors and to supply degraded responses in the event of unavailability of a component.
The platform incorporates a range of tried and tested basic components dramatically reducing specific developments, thereby reducing the cost of projects using them.
The level of reliability of software produced with COHORTE SDK also reduces operating and maintenance costs for the companies software packages.
